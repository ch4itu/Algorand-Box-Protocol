**MUTABLE AND IMMUTABLE STORAGE USING ALGORAND BOXES**

Though not cost effective, Algorand offers us flexible storage in the form of boxes.

This project is similar to what Filecoin/Arweave/Swarm want to achieve.

The core idea is deploying an app which can create n number of boxes which hold a single/similar/relevant content (like a website's HTML/CSS/JS/ASSETS). And the content can be accessed using the app_id. This repo hosts the code which validates and parses the content of the boxes.

It tries to bring on a **box://** scheme for accessing the content.

**DISCLAIMER: THIS REPO IS A HELPER FOR MY OTHER PROJECTS AND NO WAY PRODUCTION READY AND MAY SEEM TRIVIAL OR REDUNDANT FOR OTHERS.**
